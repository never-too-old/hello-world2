This is me learning Git.  I found two docs that help explain its function.  I suspect there are others that explain it 'under the hood'.

Once I understand this and play a bit, GitHub should be a relatively easy extension.

THis is the branch 'new-docs' in hell-world2.

This version of doc1.txt had less lines but I am going to add some more.

Git is tracking the changes in content but they won't be meaning ful until I commit them.

Then I can push them to GitHub for examination on the web.   8/2/20 - 10:54 am
